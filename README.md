This fitness app helps users discover exercise tutorials and build their workout routines. Users can search for exercises in three ways: by exercise name, equipment type, or target muscle group. When users find exercises they like, they can save them to create a personalized workout list that includes step-by-step tutorials and instructional YouTube videos.
